# Sentiment-Analysis
In the era of online shopping and a wide range of products available, determining product
quality is time-consuming. User reviews on platforms like Amazon and blogs are crucial for
improving customer experiences. This project aims to analyze user reviews by
building a model that assesses the worthiness of suggested products. The application
gathers data from various sources, calculates aggregate sentiment, and allows users
to compare multiple products. By employing natural language processing techniques, we can
determine customer mood and trends, aiding in efficient user review analysis. This
solution benefits both customers and product owners, enhancing decision-making and
business growth.
